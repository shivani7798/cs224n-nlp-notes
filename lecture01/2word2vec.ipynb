    "### Word2vec: Overview\n",
    "##### Word2vec is a framework for learning word vectors\n",
    "(Mikolov et al. 2013)\n",
    "#### Idea:\n",
    "• We have a large corpus (“body”) of text: a long list of words\n",
    "• Every word in a fixed vocabulary is represented by a vector\n",
    "• Go through each position t in the text, which has a center\n",
    "word c and context (“outside”) words o\n",
    "• Use the similarity of the word vectors for c and o to calculate\n",
    "the probability of o given c (or vice versa)\n",
    "• Keep adjusting the word vectors to maximize this probability"
